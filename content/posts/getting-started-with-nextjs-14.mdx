Next.js 14 introduces powerful new features that make building web applications more intuitive and performant. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of the App Router and how to leverage Server Components effectively.

## What's New in Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings several exciting improvements:

- **Turbopack**: A faster bundler written in Rust
- **Server Actions**: Simplified server-side mutations
- **Partial Prerendering**: Combine static and dynamic content
- **Improved Image Optimization**: Better performance out of the box

## Setting Up Your Project

To create a new Next.js 14 project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This sets up a project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router enabled by default.

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router uses a file-system based routing approach with some key conventions:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `page.tsx` | Defines the UI for a route |
| `layout.tsx` | Shared UI across routes |
| `loading.tsx` | Loading state |
| `error.tsx` | Error boundary |
| `not-found.tsx` | 404 page |

### Creating Your First Route

Create a file at `app/blog/page.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
      <p>This is a server component by default.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Server Components">
By default, all components in the App Router are Server Components. This means they render on the server and send HTML to the client, improving initial page load performance.
</Callout>

## Server vs Client Components

Understanding when to use each type is crucial:

### Server Components (Default)

Use for:
- Fetching data
- Accessing backend resources
- Keeping sensitive information on the server

### Client Components

Add `"use client"` directive for:
- Interactivity (onClick, onChange)
- Browser APIs (localStorage, window)
- State and effects (useState, useEffect)

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Performance Tip">
Only use `"use client"` when necessary. Keep your component tree as server-rendered as possible for better performance.
</Callout>

## Data Fetching

Next.js 14 simplifies data fetching with async Server Components:

```tsx
async function getUser(id: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`);
  return res.json();
}

export default async function UserPage({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: { id: string } 
}) {
  const user = await getUser(params.id);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in React-based web development. The App Router, combined with Server Components, provides an excellent developer experience while delivering optimal performance.

- Server Actions for mutations
- Streaming and Suspense
- Authentication patterns
- Testing strategies
